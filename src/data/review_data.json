As a seasoned sewist myself, I can say that this product is a must-have for anyone who wants to prolong the life of their rotary blades and make cutting chain pieced fabric a breeze.\n\nOne of the best features of the BladeSaver is its ability to give your used 45mm rotary blades an extended life. No longer will you have to discard your blades after only a few uses, which saves you money in the long run. Plus, the magnetic case that comes with the BladeSaver keeps your thread cutter safe when not in use or when you're on the go.\n\nAnother great aspect of this product is the ease with which it cuts through fabric. As someone who loves experimenting with different types of stitching, from top stitching to blind hemming, I appreciate anything that can make the actual cutting process faster and more efficient. The BladeSaver definitely fits the bill, and I can see it being a great fit for anyone who wants to sew more quickly and accurately.\n\nOf course, as with any product, there are a few potential drawbacks to consider. For example, some people might not love the lilac color of the BladeSaver, but that's a pretty superficial concern. Additionally, the product requires a 45mm rotary blade, so if you typically use a different size, you'll need to purchase a separate product.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Purple Hobbies LLC BladeSaver Thread Cutter Lilac to anyone who wants to get the most out of their rotary blades and streamline their sewing process. It's a small investment that can pay off in a big way, and I think it's a product that many sewists would appreciate. \n\nBottom line: With its ability to prolong the life of your rotary blades and make cutting fabric faster and easier, the BladeSaver Thread Cutter Lilac from Purple Hobbies LLC is a must-have for any sewist.

I recently got my hands on Madeira Thread's Wash Away Thread, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer. As someone who loves creative sewing and monster sewing projects, I'm always looking for ways to make my life easier. And this thread is definitely it!\n\nThe Madeira Wash Away Thread is perfect for all kinds of basting tasks, from gathering stitch to positioning pockets. And the fact that it dissolves in water (or with heat from an iron) means I don't have to spend hours removing basting stitches with an unpicker. It's a total time-saver, which means more time to sew and so!\n\nOne thing I love about this thread is that it's suitable for all domestic sewing and embroidery machines. I've got a Bernina Jeff and a Singer M3500, and I didn't have any issues using it on either of them. Plus, it's perfect for sewing alterations and custom sewing near me projects. And if you're a fan of the types of hand stitches, you can use it for back stitch by hand too.\n\nBut, as much as I love this thread, there are a few things to keep in mind. It doesn't dissolve in dry cleaning solution, so that's something to keep in mind if you're planning on using it for formal wear. And it must be stored in a dry place, like a zip lock bag, and you shouldn't handle it with wet hands. But those are pretty superficial cons, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of love to sew and want to make your life a little easier, I'd definitely recommend the Madeira Wash Away Thread. It's perfect for creative sewing and sewing mastery, and it's definitely a Sew Good investment. The Sewing Center near me even recommended it to me! So, go ahead and give it a try, and let me know how it goes!\n\nPros:\n- Time-saver\n- Suitable for all kinds of basting tasks\n- Suitable for all domestic sewing and embroidery machines\n\nCons:\n- Doesn't dissolve in dry cleaning solution\n- Must be stored in a dry place\n- Shouldn't handle it with wet hands\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you want to make your sewing life a little easier, the Madeira Wash Away Thread is definitely worth the investment.

If you're a sewist who loves to sew knit fabrics, then these needles are a must-have for your sewing kit. \n\nFirst off, let's talk about the ball point feature. These needles are designed to penetrate between the fibers of the fabric, rather than through them like a sharp needle. This means that the needles won't damage or break the knit fibers, leaving you with smooth and even stitches. As someone who's had their fair share of sewing mishaps, I can definitely appreciate this feature. \n\nThe size 10/70 is perfect for lightweight to medium weight knit fabrics, making it a versatile choice for a range of projects. And with 5 needles per package, you'll have plenty to work with. \n\nI would highly recommend these needles for anyone who wants to sew knits without the frustration of skipped stitches or damaged fabric. They're especially great for beginners who are just starting to experiment with knit fabrics. \n\nPros:\n- Ball point feature prevents damage to knit fibers\n- Size 10/70 is versatile for a range of projects\n- 5 needles per package for plenty of use\n\nCons:\n- Only suitable for knit fabrics, not recommended for woven fabrics\n\nIn conclusion, the Ball Point Jersey Machine Needles-Size 10/70 5/Pkg are a great addition to any sewist's toolkit.

Inspired by the fashion of the 70s, these caftans are a perfect addition to your wardrobe if you want to add a bit of retro glamour to your style.\n\nWhat I love about this pattern is its versatility, with two different lengths to choose from. The shorter option features fringe trim that's totally on-trend with the current fashion scene, while the ankle-length version is perfect for a day on the beach or a casual hangout with friends. The pattern is easy to follow, and even beginners won't have a hard time sewing up these caftans.\n\nThe pattern packet comes with everything you need, including sewing templates, fabric recommendations, sizing guides in multiple languages, and instructions for both caftan styles. And at just $12.94, this kit is an absolute steal! Plus, the pattern is designed and printed in the USA, so you can feel good about supporting American-made products.\n\nOne of the things I appreciate about this pattern is how it makes use of different types of stitches. You'll get to practice your flatlock stitch, stretch stitch, gathering stitch, hem stitch by hand, and even the invisible stitch by hand. If you're new to sewing, this is a fun way to learn about different types of stitches and how to use them.\n\nWhile there's a lot to love about this pattern, it's not without its cons. The sizing may be a bit limited for some, with sizes ranging from 8 to 40.

It's a flower-shaped holder with five notches to cut threads, and it's compatible with all 28mm blades. But what makes it special is the fact that it extends the life of your rotary blades.

This hot pink thread is just what you need for your next sewing project if you want to add a touch of playfulness and fun.\n\nWhat's so special about it, you ask? Well, Eloflex is an elastic thread that you can use as both the top thread and in the bobbin. This means you can sew elastic seams using a normal lock stitch on a conventional sewing machine. How cool is that? I've used it for sewing leotards, gym clothes, and stretch denim, and I'm impressed with how stretchy and durable the seams are.\n\nOne of the things I love about Eloflex is its colorfastness. Even if you use chlorine bleach to wash your garment, the thread won't lose its vibrant color. And speaking of color, this thread comes in a variety of shades, so you can choose the one that suits your project best. I went for hot pink because it's my favorite color, but there are other options like turquoise, lime, and yellow.\n\nIf you're a sewist who loves experimenting with different types of stitching, you'll also love Eloflex. You can use it for topstitching, basting, blind hem, and even buttonhole stitching. The possibilities are endless! Just make sure you adjust your sewing machine's tension and stitch length to get the best results.\n\nPro:\n- Elastic thread that allows you to sew stretchy seams on a conventional sewing machine\n- Colorfast even with chlorine bleach\n- Comes in a variety of colors\n- Can be used for different types of stitching\n\nCon:\n- Might be a bit more expensive than regular thread\n\nIn conclusion, Coats Eloflex Stretch Thread is a must-have for any sewist who wants to add a touch of stretchiness and fun to their projects. It's perfect for sewing leotards, gym clothes, cosplay, swimwear, and stretch denim, and it comes in a variety of shades.

That's why I was so excited to try out the Seam Ripper 2 Pack - Thread Remover Sewing Supplies - Stitch Remover Tool for Sewing, Crafting Notions and Quilting - Thread Cutter Unpicker Sewing Accessories and Supplies. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint!\n\nFirst of all, the colors are so cute and fun! I got the large seam ripper in dark pink and the small one in light pink - they definitely add a pop of color to my sewing supplies. But beyond aesthetics, these seam rippers are actually really great quality. The metal edges are sharp and durable, which makes them perfect for picking out those pesky mistakes without damaging the fabric.\n\nOne of my favorite things about these seam rippers is how user-friendly they are. The long flat design makes them very comfortable to hold, and the strong grip ensures that they won't slip out of your hand while you're working. Plus, they're very convenient for picking and ripping fine stitches on fabrics - a true lifesaver when you're trying to rip out basting stitches or under stitching.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Seam Ripper 2 Pack to anyone who loves quality sewing and attention to detail. It's a great tool for both beginners and experienced sewists, and it's really affordable too! \n\nPros:\n- Sharp and durable metal edges\n- User-friendly design that's easy to hold\n- Beautiful and fun colors\n- Very affordable\n\nCons:\n- The plastic material might not be as environmentally friendly as some other options\n\nBottom Line: If you're looking for a quality seam ripper that won't break the bank, the Seam Ripper 2 Pack is definitely worth checking out. I give it a rating of 8 out of 10 - it's not perfect, but it's a great tool to have in your sewing arsenal.",

When I first heard about this product, I was skeptical, but boy, was I wrong! This thread is seriously cool and adds a whole new level of creativity to your embroidery projects.\n\nFirst off, the glow in the dark effect is legit. It's not like those cheap glow-in-the-dark stickers you used to put on your ceiling as a kid - this thread actually glows brightly and lasts for a few hours. I've used it for Halloween costumes, personalized pillowcases, and even on some funky fashion pieces. It's definitely a conversation starter!\n\nThe thread itself is strong and durable, which is great for machine embroidery, quilting, and general sewing projects. Plus, the mini spools are compatible with a variety of machines, so you can use it no matter what brand you prefer. And, bonus, it's also skin-friendly and safe to use on fabric that will touch your skin.\n\nNow, for the pro con list:\n\nPros:\n- Fun and unique addition to embroidery projects\n- Strong and durable thread\n- Mini spools are compatible with a variety of machines\n- Skin-friendly and safe to use\n- Can be used for a variety of projects, not just Halloween or holiday-themed ones\n\nCons:\n- Limited color options (only 16 in the kit)\n- Glow effect may fade over time with repeated washing\n\nOverall, I highly recommend New brothread's Luminary Glow in The Dark thread for anyone who wants to add a little something extra to their embroidery game. It's a fun and unique product that definitely stands out from the crowd. So, stitch on, my friends, and let your creativity shine (literally).\n\nBottom Line: 8.5/10",

            "content": "Hey there, fellow sewing fans - it's Emma, back with another review! Today I'm taking a closer look at the Best Choice Products Compact Sewing Machine, a portable machine that promises to be perfect for beginners. With its 42-piece beginner's kit and 12 stitch patterns, this machine certainly has a lot going for it. But is it really the best choice for those just starting out on their sewing journey? Let's dive in and find out.\n\nFirst things first - let's talk about the features. The Best Choice Compact Sewing Machine comes with all the basics you need to get started, including a light to help you see what you're doing, a foot pedal to control your stitching speed, and a storage drawer to keep your supplies organized. It's also compact and lightweight, so you can easily take it with you on the go.\n\nOne thing I really appreciate about this machine is that it has a variety of stitch patterns, including zigzag, straight, and even a buttonhole stitch. This means you can experiment with different types of stitching and create a range of projects, from basic alterations to custom sewing projects. It's a great way to get a feel for what you like and what you're good at.\n\nOf course, like any product, there are pros and cons. Here's what I think:\n\nPros:\n- Compact and lightweight\n- Comes with a lot of useful accessories\n- Has a variety of stitch patterns to experiment with\n\nCons:\n- Not as sturdy or durable as more expensive machines\n- The pink and white color scheme might not be everyone's cup of tea\n\nOverall, I'd say that the Best Choice Compact Sewing Machine is a solid option for beginners who want to dip their toes into the world of sewing. It has enough features to keep you busy, but not so many that you'll feel overwhelmed. The included beginner's kit is a nice touch, too. If you're looking for a more serious machine that can handle heavy-duty sewing, this might not be the one for you. But if you're just starting out and want a machine that won't leave you in stitches (see what I did there?), this one is definitely worth considering.\n\nBottom line: I'd give the Best Choice Compact Sewing Machine a solid 8 out of 10. It's not perfect, but it's a great option for beginners who want to learn the basics of sewing without breaking the bank. So go ahead and sew it all, my friends!",

I used it for a custom table runner for a friend's wedding, and it held up beautifully after being handled and washed multiple times.\n\nOverall, I'd say this ribbon would be a great fit for anyone looking to add a touch of metallic magic to their sewing/crafting projects. Whether you're a beginner just starting out with basic sewing stitches or a sewing mastery pro who can back stitch by hand in their sleep, the Galena Metallic Burgundy Red Ribbon is sure to be a hit. \n\nPROS:\n- Gorgeous metallic sheen\n- Rich burgundy red hue\n- 12 spools for multiple projects\n- Thin yet sturdy construction \n\nCONS:\n- Might not be the best fit for those who don't like using metallic materials \n- For those who prefer thicker ribbons, this might be too thin \n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend the Galena Metallic Burgundy Red Ribbon to anyone who loves to sew, craft, or just add a little sparkle to their life! It's definitely worth the price, and I can't wait to see what amazing projects y'all come up with using it. Sew good, friends! \n\nBOTTOM LINE: 8/10",

            "content": "Are you tired of using the same old presser foot for your sewing projects? Look no further than the HARFINGTON 15pcs Presser Foot Kit! This kit includes a variety of presser feet to help you tackle any project, from etch stitch to gathering stitch and everything in between.\n\nAs a creative sewist, I love experimenting with different types of stitching, and this kit has allowed me to do just that. The presser feet are made of both zinc alloy and plastic, so they are durable while still being lightweight and easy to use.\n\nThe kit is also versatile, as it works with most low-shank home sewing machines. As someone who loves to try out different machines, this is a huge plus. Plus, the small size of the presser feet makes them easy to store and transport, perfect for taking with you to sewing classes or on the go.\n\nOne of my favorite features of the kit is the invisible stitch by hand presser foot. This has been a game-changer for me when it comes to hemming pants or skirts. I also appreciate the hem stitch by hand presser foot, which allows me to create a clean and professional hem on any garment.\n\nWhile the kit has many pros, there are a few cons to consider. The plastic parts of the presser feet may not be as durable as the zinc alloy parts, and the kit only comes in one color (silver). However, these are minor issues that do not detract from the overall quality of the kit.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the HARFINGTON 15pcs Presser Foot Kit to anyone looking to up their sewing game. Whether you're a beginner looking to experiment with different types of stitches or an experienced sewist looking for new tools to add to your sewing box, this kit has something for everyone. With a variety of presser feet and a reasonable price point, it's a no-brainer for anyone looking to sew and so much more! \n\nBottom line: 8.5/10",

That's why I was so excited to try out the VLOXO Cordless Electric Scissors. Let me tell you, these scissors are a game-changer!\n\nFirst off, the rotary cutter for fabric is incredibly powerful - it cuts through even the thickest fabrics like butter. And with its safety lock, I don't have to worry about accidentally cutting myself or anyone else. Plus, the rechargeable battery means I never have to worry about running out of juice mid-project.\n\nThe VLOXO Cordless Electric Scissors also come with a storage box, which is super handy for keeping everything together and organized. And at just $38.99, it's an affordable addition to any sewist's toolkit.\n\nWhile these scissors are perfect for all types of sewing projects, I think they would be especially helpful for those who do a lot of quilting. The ability to cut through multiple layers of fabric with ease is a godsend when you're trying to piece together a quilt top.\n\nPros:\n- Powerful cutting ability\n- Safety lock\n- Rechargeable battery\n- Comes with storage box\n- Affordable price\n\nCons:\n- Only comes in one color (not a big deal, but worth mentioning)\n\nIn conclusion, I would highly recommend the VLOXO Cordless Electric Scissors to anyone in the sewing world, from the novice sewer to the seasoned pro. They're powerful, efficient, and affordable - what more could you want? With a rating of 9 out of 10, these scissors are a must-have in any sewist's toolbox.",

            "content": "When it comes to creative sewing, I love trying out different types of hand stitches and experimenting with hemming techniques. But sometimes, cutting thread can be a real pain in the butt. That's where the BladeSaver Thread Cutter comes in - and boy, does it cut like a boss!\n\nThis handy little tool is perfect for anyone who loves to sew and wants to save time and energy when cutting thread. With its sleek pink design and compact size, the BladeSaver is easy to use and fits comfortably in your hand. Plus, it's super sharp and cuts through thread like a hot knife through butter.\n\nOne of my favorite features of the BladeSaver is the retractable blade. This means you can keep it safely tucked away in your sewing kit when you're not using it, and avoid any accidental cuts. But when you're ready to cut, just press down on the button and the blade pops out - easy peasy!\n\nThe BladeSaver is also great for cutting thread in awkward places, like when you're working on a gathered skirt or attaching bias tape. And if you're a fan of back stitch by hand or gathering stitch, you'll love how quickly and easily you can snip your threads with this tool.\n\nOf course, like any sewing tool, there are pros and cons to the BladeSaver. Here's a quick rundown:\n\nPros:\n\n- Sharp, retractable blade for easy cutting\n- Compact size and stylish pink design\n- Perfect for cutting thread in awkward places\n- Makes hem stitch by hand and other hand stitches a breeze\n\nCons:\n\n- Some users may prefer a different color (but come on, pink is awesome!)\n- Blade may need to be replaced after extended use (but at this price point, that's totally reasonable)\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the BladeSaver Thread Cutter to anyone who loves to sew. It's a simple yet effective tool that will save you time and frustration in your sewing projects. Whether you're into byhandlondon patterns or love to sew with Sew and So fabrics, the BladeSaver is a must-have for your kit.\n\nBottom line: I give the BladeSaver Thread Cutter a solid 8.5 out of 10 - it's a great tool at a great price!",

And while they're extremely useful, they can also be quite expensive to replace.

Simply attach your used 45mm rotary blade to the Bladesaver and you're all set. The blade will be securely held in place and ready to cut your fabric. And don't worry about the blade being too dull to cut - the Bladesaver actually sharpens the blade as you use it! \n\nOne thing I love about the Bladesaver is that it comes with a magnetic case to keep it safe when not in use.
